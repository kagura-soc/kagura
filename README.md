# Kagura
Extensible ActivityPub server.

Currently, we are prioritizing implementation to ensure minimal functionality, so it may be very slow and unstable. It is not recommended to run it in a production environment.
## Differences from Firefly
Kagura was redesigned from scratch, and the following features that were planned to be implemented in Firefly (virtually a prototype) have been removed:

* Misskey API
* ATProtocol Integration

(The Misskey-compatible API may be offered as a plugin once development stabilizes.)
